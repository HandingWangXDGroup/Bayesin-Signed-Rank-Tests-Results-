# Bayesin-Signed-Rank-Tests-Results-
The results of performing Bayesian signed-rank test between IBEA-MS and AK-IBEA variants on each problem. On each problem, we create a result matrix of size 30*4 with the results of 30 independent runs of the four algorithms (AK-IBEA1, AK-IBEA2, AK-IBEA3 and IBEA-MS). Then, we compare the AK-IBEA columns with IBEA-MS respectively and perform the Bayesian signed-rank test to get the result figures. In addition, all problems are subjected to Bayesian signed-rank tests under two evaluation metrics, IGD and HV, respectively.
